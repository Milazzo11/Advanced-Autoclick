This programmable autoclicker allows users to create complex click patterns.

The program will read in TXT files of the below format:

mouse-x mouse-y wait-time

For example:

100 200 1
50 20 2
105 1005 3

This would click at mouse location x-100 y-200, wait 1 second, click at x-50 y-20, etc.
The program also allows users to find their mouse coordinates to make it easier to create proper click history files.

Enjoy :)
